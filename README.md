# Welcome to SuperFields!

## Overview

This is a collection of hopefully useful Vaadin 14 and 23+ components, grouped into several sub-projects:
* `superfields` are various input components;
* `demo-v23` contains an app for Vaadin 23+ that shows all components - [see the demo online](https://superfields.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku

## Installation

[SuperFields are also available in Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/superfields). If you find this library useful, consider rating it there or leaving a review. Thanks :)

SuperFields work with Vaadin 23 (and above) and Vaadin 14 LTS.

### Vaadin 23+ and Java 11

Starting with **version 0.12** SuperFields work with the latest major Vaadin version. **Java 11** or newer is required. 

#### Maven setup

This is the relevant dependency:
```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.vaadin.miki</groupId>
   <artifactId>superfields</artifactId>
   <version>{VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

Here is the repository:
```
<repository>
   <id>vaadin-addons</id>
   <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>
```

Note that not every version will be released in the Vaadin Directory, as it has to be done manually.

All releases are available:
* as binaries under [project's releases](https://github.com/vaadin-miki/super-fields/releases)
* as Maven packages from [GitHub packages](https://github.com/vaadin-miki/super-fields/packages/177670)

### Vaadin 14 LTS and Java 8

Versions below **0.12** work only with Vaadin 14 LTS.

SuperFields in general **should** be compatible with Vaadin 14 LTS and with Java 8. These versions are released in the Vaadin Directory marked with `-vaadin14` suffix in the version, e.g. `0.12.0-vaadin14`. Their functionality is identical to the official release.

This repository has a branch `java-8` which contains the most recent release compatible with Java 8 and Vaadin 14 LTS. Please note that Java 8 has been released in 2014. Also, versions compatible with Vaadin 14 LTS will be maintained only as long as Vaadin 14 LTS is.
