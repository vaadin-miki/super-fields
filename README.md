# Welcome to SuperFields!

## Overview

This is a collection of hopefully useful Vaadin 14 and 23+ components, grouped into several subprojects:
* `superfields` are various input components;
* `demo-v23` contains an app for Vaadin 23+ that shows all components - [see the demo online](https://demo.unforgiven.pl/superfields/) or run it yourself with `mvn package jetty:run`

## Installation

[SuperFields are also available in Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/superfields). If you find this library useful, consider rating it there or leaving a review. Thanks :)

SuperFields work with Vaadin 23 (and above) and Vaadin 14 LTS (only as long as Vaadin 14 is officially supported).

### Vaadin 23+ and Java 11

Starting with **version 0.12** SuperFields work with the latest major Vaadin version. **Java 11** or newer is required.

From **version 0.16** every release is available in Maven Central. Please note that the `groupId` of the project **has changed** from `org.vaadin.miki` to `pl.unforgiven`. Class names and package names **have not changed**.

#### Maven setup

This is the relevant dependency:
```
<dependency>
   <groupId>pl.unforgiven</groupId>
   <artifactId>superfields</artifactId>
   <version>{VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

All releases are available:
* in Maven Central
* as binaries under [project's releases](https://github.com/vaadin-miki/super-fields/releases)
* as Maven packages from [GitHub packages](https://github.com/vaadin-miki/super-fields/packages/177670) or from [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/superfields)

### Vaadin 14 LTS and Java 8

Versions below **0.12** work only with Vaadin 14 LTS.

SuperFields in general **should** be compatible with Vaadin 14 LTS and with Java 8. Each release has a corresponding version marked with `-vaadin14` suffix in the number, e.g. `0.12.0-vaadin14`. The functionality is identical to the official release.

These releases are **not available** in Maven Central nor in GitHub. Instead, they can only be obtained from [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/superfields). Here is the required repository:
```
<repository>
   <id>vaadin-addons</id>
   <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>
```

This repository has a branch `java-8` which contains the code for the most recent release compatible with Java 8 and Vaadin 14 LTS. Please note that Java 8 has been released in 2014. Also, versions compatible with Vaadin 14 LTS will be maintained only as long as Vaadin 14 LTS is.
