# SuperFields demo

This app showcases the components found in other parts of this project, most importantly - the SuperFields.

You can run it as any other Vaadin app by `mvn jetty:run`.

This app is also available on my server: https://demo.unforgiven.pl/superfields - it gets automatically deployed on every release.
