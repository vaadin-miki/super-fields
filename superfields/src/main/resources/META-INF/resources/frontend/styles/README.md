okay, so these .js files that contain css and export it as a constant are ugly and probably not the best practice?
(though looking at the internals of vaadin webcomponents this seems to be the best practice...)
however, this is the only way I know of that works, and I am not the best javascript developer out there
so, if you know how to turn those into actual css files that are actually included into the shadow root, please help
thanks
